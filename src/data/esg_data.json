(2) Exit coal by 2025 in Europe and 2027 in the rest of the world, prioritizing closure, then conversion to low-carbon energy, then disposal if needed. (3) Develop green gases: biomethane (4 TWh in France by 2030; \u20ac800m 2018-2023 rising to \u20ac2bn by 2030; +700 GWh in France by 2023) and renewable hydrogen (4 GW electrolysers, 700 km network, 1 TWh storage, integrate 30 TWh hydrogen, >100 refueling stations by 2030). (4) Support customer decarbonization with a 2030 target of 45 mt CO2 eq avoided via ENGIE products/services and a methodology developed with external partners. (5) Reduce workplace/working-method emissions with Net Zero by 2030, including >35% building electricity reduction and >100% green vehicle fleet share by 2030.

(2) Exit coal (2025 Europe; 2027 worldwide) and maintain/convert flexible thermal generation (CCGT able to use green gases over time). (3) Build renewable gases/hydrogen value chains: develop renewable hydrogen capacity (0.6 GW in 2025; 4 GW in 2030); develop hydrogen networks/storage and expand biomethane (France objectives and network injection). (4) Expand decentralized/local energy networks and customer solutions (Energy Solutions target 8 GW by 2025; Paris cooling network extension 158 km by 2042). (5) Enablement: carbon budgets per GBU and GHG-linked management remuneration; decarbonize work processes by 2030; supplier engagement (250 preferred suppliers and extension to 1,500 Class A suppliers by 2030).",
